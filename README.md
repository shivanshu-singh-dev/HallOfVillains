## 👨‍💻 Why I Built This

With AI tools like Claude, building visually stunning websites has become more accessible than ever. I wanted to test this shift — to see how much easier development has become if you simply **guide the AI right**.

This project is a personal experiment: a creative playground powered by prompts, anime passion, and a little chaos.  
It proved that **you don’t need to write every line yourself to create something beautiful.**

## 💡 The Idea: Hall of Villains

A tribute to the **most iconic, fearsome, and intelligent villains from the anime universe**.  
This isn't just a gallery — it's a digital **hall of legends**, where charisma and cruelty collide.

Each villain is showcased with:
- 🎭 An evocative image  
- 🗯️ A powerful quote capturing their philosophy  
- 📜 A short description of their power and presence  
- 💎 A refined gold-black theme for elegance and menace

## 🦹 Featured Villains

Legends like **Sosuke Aizen**, **Makima**, **Esdeath**, **Sukuna**, **Doflamingo**, **Blackbeard**, and more.

They aren’t evil for evil’s sake.  
They’re **ideologies** — order, chaos, control, freedom — given terrifying form.
